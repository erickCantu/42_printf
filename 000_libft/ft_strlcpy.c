/*
	The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions copy and concatenate strings 
	respectively. They are designed to be safer, more consistent, and less 
	error prone replacements for strncpy(3) and strncat(3).  
	Unlike those functions, strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the 
	buffer (not just the length) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the result 
	(as long as size is larger than 0 or, in the case of strlcat(), as long as 
	there is at least one byte free in dst).  Note that a byte for the NUL 
	should be included in size.  Also note that strlcpy() and strlcat() only 
	operate on true “C” strings.
	This means that for strlcpy() src must be NUL-terminated and for 
	strlcat() both src and dst must be NUL-terminated.
	
	The strlcpy() function copies up to size - 1 characters from the 
	NUL-terminated string src to dst, NUL-terminating theresult.

	RETURN VALUES
     The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions return the total length of the 
	 string they tried to create.  For strlcpy() that means the length of src.
	 For strlcat() that means the initial length of dst plus the length of src.
	 While this may seem somewhat confusing, it was done to make truncation 
	 detection simple.
